# ü™Ñ Browser Shell Scripting Guide

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Introduction

Welcome to the enchanted world of Tortal Shell scripting‚Äîwhere variables magically expand ‚ú®, loops loop (usually), and command substitution is literal wizardry üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Here you'll learn how to tame the shell dragon üêâ, write scripts that are both useful and entertaining, and hopefully avoid sentient scripts (though no guarantees).

The shell speaks a Bash-like dialect featuring variable spells, looping incantations, conditional enchantments, arithmetic alchemy, pipes, chaining spells, and user-defined function charms.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Writing Scripts

Scripts are magical incantations you write in multi-line blocks. Each command supports variables, math, and pipes.

### üìù Basic Syntax

```sh
# Create a magic variable
name="wizard"
echo "Greetings, $name"

# Math magic without a wand
count=$((1 + 2 * 3))
echo $count
```

Yes, the math checks out. No abacus required.

## üß© Control Structures

### ü§î Basic If Statements

```sh
if [ $count -le 5 ]; then
  echo "Count is tiny"
else
  echo "Count is mighty"
fi
```

* Use `[ ... ]` or `test` for conditions.
* Ends with `fi`‚Äî"if" spelled backward. Because whimsy.

### üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Conditional Spellcasting: if, elif, else, fi

Sometimes a wizard's logic must branch‚Äîlike a staff made from the World Tree itself. When one simple `if` won't do, call upon its ancient siblings: `elif` (the mystical middle path), and `else` (the fallback incantation).

```sh
read mood "How do you feel today, brave sorcerer?" meh

if [ "$mood" = "elated" ]; then
  echo "‚ú® You radiate pure mana! Cast with confidence."
elif [ "$mood" = "focused" ]; then
  echo "üß† Your mind is sharp. The arcane bends to your will."
elif [ "$mood" = "meh" ]; then
  echo "üòê A neutral aura... perhaps a potion would help?"
elif [ "$mood" = "cursed" ]; then
  echo "‚ò†Ô∏è Dark energies swirl. Proceed with caution!"
else
  echo "‚ùì Mood unknown. Divination spell required."
fi
```

**Output:**
```
$ run mood.sh
$ How do you feel today, brave sorcerer?
> focused
$ üß† Your mind is sharp. The arcane bends to your will.
```

Use it wisely, spellwright. Not all conditions are created equal, but all deserve a proper incantation.

### üßÆ Numeric Prophecies: if, elif, else, fi with Numbers

Whether counting dragons, mana crystals, or cursed runes, numeric logic is a must for any terminal sorcerer. Here's how to wield it:

```sh
read level "What is your wizard level?" 0

if [ $level -ge 100 ]; then
  echo "üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Archmage detected. All spells unlocked. Reality is optional."
elif [ $level -ge 50 ]; then
  echo "üîÆ High Mage status. You may now summon lesser deities."
elif [ $level >= 10 ]; then
  echo "‚ú® Apprentice no more! Welcome to the big leagues."
elif [ $level > 0 ]; then
  echo "üìò Beginner scroll unlocked. Try not to explode anything."
else
  echo "üê£ No magic detected. Perhaps try waving the wand first?"
fi
```

**Output:**
```
$ run level.sh
$ What is your wizard level?
> 42
$ ‚ú® Apprentice no more! Welcome to the big leagues.
```

* Use `-gt` (`>`), `-lt` (`<`), `-le` (`<=`), `-ge` (`>=`), `-eq`, and `-ne` for all your numerical rituals.
* Unlike JavaScript, this shell doesn't lie about types. These are real number comparisons, not arcane coercions.
* Don't forget: `fi` closes the block. It's short for "*finished incantation*" (probably).

::: warning
Don't use `=`, `==`, or `===` for numerical comparisons. That will not work and cause a rift to open between you and the terminal.
:::

### üî† String Comparison

```sh
if [ "$NAME" = "Merlin" ]; then
  echo "Welcome back, wizard!"
fi
```

* `=`, `==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==` supported for equality checks. Because we're cool like that.
* Always quote your variables. Or don‚Äôt and enjoy endless debugging fun.

### üî¢ Numeric Comparison

```sh
if [ "$COUNT" -gt 3 ]; then
  echo "You have more than three dragons."
fi
```

### üìÇ File Magic Checks

#### üîÆ Does it Exist?

Check if a mystical artifact‚Äîer, file‚Äîexists in your enchanted filesystem:

```sh
artifact="/wizards.txt"
if test -e "$artifact"; then
  echo "‚ú® Ah-ha! '$artifact' exists in this realm!"
else
  echo "üåÄ '$artifact' seems lost to the void..."
fi
```

#### üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è File or Directory Spell?

Not sure if you're looking at a simple spell scroll (file) or an entire magical kingdom (directory)? Cast these incantations:

```sh
mystery="/realm"
if test -f "$mystery"; then
  echo "üìú '$mystery' is a mere scroll of secrets."
fi

if test -d "$mystery"; then
  echo "üè∞ '$mystery' is a sprawling kingdom to explore!"
fi
```

Keep your file system tidy, and beware the curses of missing files! üîç‚ú®

### ‚ôªÔ∏è While Loops

Ah, the noble while loop‚Äîgreat for repeating spells until a condition fizzles.

```sh
count=1
while [ $count -le 3 ]; do
  echo "Looping spell #$count"
  count=$((count + 1))
done
```

* Automatically stops at 10,000 iterations, to protect your browser from magical meltdown.

::: danger ‚ö†Ô∏è Beware Infinite Loops
```sh{4}
count=0
while [ $count -eq 0 ]; do
  echo "This loop shall never end!"
  # no increment
done
```

* You forgot the counter spell (aka increment). Always update your condition or risk browser implosion üò±
:::

#### ‚ûï While with Increment

```sh
count=0
while [ $count -lt 5 ]; do
  echo "Count is currently $count"
  count++
done
```

* Yes, post-increment works. The shell speaks fluent ++.

#### ‚õî While with `break`

```sh
count=0
while [ $count -lt 5 ]; do
  if [ $count -eq 3 ]; then
    echo "Too spicy at $count, breaking the loop!"
    break
  fi
  echo "Tolerable count: $count"
  count=$((count + 1))
done
```

* `break` exits the loop like you just spotted a Minotaur. Swiftly and with purpose.

#### ‚Ü™Ô∏è While with `continue`

```sh
count=0
while [ $count -lt 5 ]; do
  count=$((count + 1))
  if [ $count -eq 3 ]; then
    echo "Count $count? Nah, we skip that nonsense."
    continue
  fi
  echo "Processing count $count"
done
```

* `continue` skips just this loop iteration. Great for dodging cursed numbers (looking at you, 3).


### üîÅ For Loops: March of the Variables

Need to cast a spell on a list of things? `for` loops let each item take the stage like a lineup of brave adventurers.

```sh
for n in 1 2 3; do
  echo "Looping through $n"
done
```

* It‚Äôs like roll call for your variables. Each one gets its 15 milliseconds of fame.

####  üßÆ Dynamic For Loops with `seq`

Want your loop to count instead of conjuring hardcoded values?

```sh
for i in $(seq 1 4); do
  echo "Index $i"
done
```

**Output:**
```
Index 1
Index 2
Index 3
Index 4
```

Feeling spicy? Add a step and turn your loop into a teleportation spell:

```sh
for x in $(seq 0 2 8); do
  echo "Teleporting to even number: $x"
done
```

**Output:**
```
Teleporting to even number: 0
Teleporting to even number: 2
Teleporting to even number: 4
Teleporting to even number: 6
Teleporting to even number: 8
```

#### üîÅ Nested Loops: Chaos and Beauty

```sh
for outer in A B; do
  for inner in 1 2; do
    echo "$outer$inner"
  done
done
```

* Nesting loops is totally legal. Just remember to close every `do` with a `done`, or risk opening a recursive rift in the shell continuum.

### üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Case Statements: Spell Selection Mode

Sometimes your script needs to pick from a magical menu of options. That‚Äôs where case comes in ‚Äî like a choose-your-own-adventure scroll üßæ.

```sh
spell="fireball"
case $spell in
  fireball) echo "üî• You cast Fireball. It's super effective!" ;;
  iceblast) echo "‚ùÑÔ∏è Iceblast conjured! Enemies are chilled." ;;
  teleport) echo "‚ú® *Poof* You're somewhere else." ;;
  *) echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Unknown spell! Wild magic surges..." ;;
esac
```

* Each option is followed by ) and ends with ;; ‚Äî like a polite bow after each performance.
* The *\** (*asterisk*) is your catch-all safety net. It ensures your script doesn‚Äôt panic if someone types `spell=banana`.

Need input from a suspicious user?

```sh
read spell "Choose your spell:" sparkle
case $spell in
  sparkle) echo "üåü You shimmer with fabulous energy!" ;;
  smite) echo "‚ö° Divine justice rains down." ;;
  vanish) echo "üö™ You've left the building." ;;
  *) echo "‚ùì That spell is... not in this realm." ;;
esac
```

::: tip ‚ú® Pro tip
`case` statements are great for branching logic with style ‚Äî like `if`/`else` but way more dramatic.
:::

## üõ†Ô∏è Functions: Your Reusable Wizardry

Functions are the enchanted scrolls of shell scripting ‚Äî reusable blocks of logic that you can summon by name, pass offerings (a.k.a. arguments), and even loop into recursion rituals ‚ú®. They help you clean up your spells, organize your incantations, and avoid repeating yourself like a cursed parrot.

### ‚ú® Defining a Function

```sh
greet(name) {
  echo "‚ú® Hello, $name!"
}
```

Want to go old school? Use positional spell slots:

```sh
multiply() {
  echo $(($1 * $2))
}
```

Or stick with mystical named parameters:

```sh
add(x, y) {
  echo $((x + y))
}
```

> You can mix and match styles. It won't summon demons. Probably.

### üó£Ô∏è Calling a Function

```sh
greet Merlin
sum=$(add 7 5)
echo "Total magic power: $sum"
```

Yes, you can nest function calls inside substitutions inside arithmetic inside an existential crisis.

### ‚èπÔ∏è Returning Early

```sh
check_level(level) {
  if [ $level -lt 10 ]; then
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Too weak!"
    return 1
  fi
  echo "‚ú® Access granted."
}

check_level $1
```

**Output:**
```
$ run check.sh 4
‚ö†Ô∏è Too weak!
```

* Use `return` to exit a function without drama.
  - `return 0` (or no `return`) indicates successful function execution.
  - `return` with anything else indicates failure.
* Use `exit` if you want to rage-quit the entire script.

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Example: Recursive Factorial

```sh
factorial(n) {
  if [ $n -le 1 ]; then
    echo 1
    return
  fi
  prev=$(factorial $((n - 1)))
  echo $((n * prev))
}

echo "$1! = $(factorial $1)"
```

**Output:**
```
$ run factorial.sh 5
5! = 120
```

Perfect for impressing mortals or scaring JavaScript devs.

### üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Example: File Type Detective

```sh
describe_file(target) {
  if test -d $target; then
    echo "üìÇ $target is a directory"
  elif test -f $target; then
    echo "üìÑ $target is a file"
  else
    echo "‚ùì $target does not exist"
  fi
}

describe_file /tmp
describe_file ./banana.png
```

Detective work, minus the trench coat.

### üåø Example: Fibonacci Spell

```sh
doNewLine=$2

fibonacci(n) {
  a=0
  b=1
  for i in $(seq 1 $n); do
    if [ $doNewLine = "true" ]; then
      echo "$a "
    else
      echo -n "$a "
    fi
    next=$((a + b))
    a=$b
    b=$next
  done
  echo
}

fibonacci $1
```

**Output:**
```sh
$ run fib.sh 7 false
0 1 1 2 3 5 8
```

```sh
$ run fib.sh 7 true
0
1
1
2
3
5
8
```

If you're summoning Fibonacci, you're either solving a riddle or flexing in front of your terminal.

Use functions early, use them often, and remember: any sufficiently advanced function is indistinguishable from magic. üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

## ‚ú® Command Substitution: Summoning Output Into the Present

Command substitution is a spell of transmutation ü™Ñ‚Äîit plucks the output of one incantation and teleports it directly into another. Like stuffing a miniature spellbook inside a fireball. Very efficient. Slightly unstable.

### üß™ Basic Alchemy

```sh
echo "Now: `date`"
CURRENT=`pwd`
echo "Current directory: $CURRENT"
```

Or, cast with modern wizard syntax (fewer backticks, less arcane suffering):

```sh
FILES=$(ls | count)
echo "Number of magical artifacts: $FILES"
```

### ü™û Use Cases for Command Teleportation

* üîç Capture output and bottle it in a variable
* üß© Pass spells as arguments to other spells
* üîÅ Conjure dynamic ranges in for loops
* üß† Create nested incantations like a wizard inception

### Example: Daily Augury

```sh
echo "Today is: $(date +%A)"
```

**Output:**
```
Today is: Friday
```

### Example: Know Thyself

```sh
user=$(whoami)
echo "Welcome, $user. The terminal recognizes you."
```

### Example: With Arcane Math

```sh
runes=$(ls | count)
echo "Runes found: $runes. Potential power level: $((runes * 42))"
```

### Example: Russian Doll Summoning

```sh
count=$((5 * $(echo $((5 * $(echo $((5 * $(echo 1)))))))))
echo "Layers of sorcery: $count"
```

**Output:**
```
$ Layers of sorcery: 125
```

::: details üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Explanation of the Spellbook
The innermost `echo 1` returns `1`

Then `5 * 1 ‚Üí 5`

Then `5 * 5 ‚Üí 25`

Then `5 * 25 ‚Üí 125`
:::

> üìö This is how wizards do math‚Äîby nesting spells until numbers fall out.

Careful‚Äînesting substitutions too deeply may open a tiny portal to the Subshell Realm. Proceed with wisdom (and a Ctrl+C).

>ü™Ñ All summoned output is collapsed into a single line. Newlines are quietly swept under the rug and replaced with spaces. It's tidier that way.

## ü™Ñ Chaining & Piping: Spells in Sequence

Behold the secret incantations that bind your shell commands together‚Äîlike linking runes on a scroll. Pipes `|` pass outputs from one spell to the next, while chaining operators `&&` and `||` decide what happens when magic fizzles or succeeds.

### üß™ The Alchemist‚Äôs Pipe (`|`)

```sh
ls | grep "txt"
```

üîÆ This channels the results of `ls` into `grep`, filtering only the scrolls that mention *txt*. Think of it as divination through text-based crystal balls.

```sh
echo "dragon egg wand cloak" | count
```

‚öóÔ∏è Pipe your spell components into `count` to tally how many items you‚Äôve conjured. Handy for inventories, to-do lists, or suspiciously long snack orders.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Conditional Magic with `&&` and `||`

#### üéØ `&&` ‚Äî Only If the First Spell Lands
```sh
mkdir tower && cd tower
```

üè∞ Create the tower, then teleport inside‚Äîbut only if the tower construction spell succeeds.

#### üí• `||` ‚Äî If the First Spell Explodes

```sh
run unknownspell || echo "Spell fizzled!"
```

üò± When a spell fails, a backup chant kicks in. Think of it as magical insurance.

### üßÆ Combo Rituals: Piping + Logic

```sh
echo "chosen one" >> prophecy.txt && cat prophecy.txt | grep -s "chosen one" && echo "‚ú® The prophecy is true!" || echo "‚ùå False alarm."
```

* `echo` conjures up a new file from the ether with 'chosen one' in it
* `cat` conjures the ancient prophecy
* `grep -s` seeks the foretold hero (while suppressing output)
* If found, trumpet your discovery üé∫
* If not, mutter and move on

‚ú® It's like an enchanted decision tree‚Äîwith more scrolls and fewer elves.

> Let your logic flow like mana‚Äîthrough pipes and runes‚Äîbinding your commands together into glorious, enchanted automation. üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Wizardly Tips & Tricks

Here lie a handful of enchanted scrolls to sharpen your scripting sorcery. Whether you're conjuring loops or binding spells together, these tricks will make your commandcraft smoother than a phoenix feather quill.

### üîÅ Summon Output with Command Substitution

```sh
echo "The stars say: `date`"
FILES=$(ls | count)
echo "üìÇ Files discovered: $FILES"
```

üåü Use backticks or `$(...)` to invoke command results mid-incantation. It's like spellcasting with echo-location.

> [üßÆ Why `count` and not `wc`?](#count-things-reliably) ‚Äî Because `wc` fibs and `count` is a truth-teller.

#### üß† Enchant Arithmetic on the Fly

You can also evaluate mathmatical expressions and save them to a variable. In this case, note the syntax is `$((expression))`:

```sh
STRENGTH=$((5 + 2 * 3))
echo "üß† Spell power: $STRENGTH"
```

**Output:**
```
$ üß† Spell power: 11
```

> No wand necessary. Yes, we honor the sacred laws of [PEMDAS](https://www.mathsisfun.com/operation-order-pemdas.html). Order matters‚Äîeven in magic.

### üîó Chain Spells for Conditional Casting

```sh
mkdir logs && echo "üìù Logs chamber summoned"
cat scroll.txt || echo "‚ùå That scroll vanished"
mkdir cave && cd cave || echo "üö´ No entry to the cave!"
```

Use `&&` to proceed if the magic succeeds, or `||` to gracefully recover when your potion explodes.

### üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Prompt the Apprentice with `read`

```sh
read wizard_name "What name do you answer to?" Merlin
echo "‚ú® Welcome, $wizard_name"
```

Perfect for interactive scripts, fortune tellers, and dramatic entrances.

### üîÑ Write Once, Cast Forever with Functions

```sh
announce(msg) {
  echo "üì£ Hear ye: $msg"
}

announce "The dragons have returned!"
```

Reusable magic circles. Name them, call them, wield them.

### üîê Preserve Your Secrets with export

```sh
export FAVORITE_SPELL=polymorph
```

Stored safely in your arcane environment, `FAVORITE_SPELL` now follows you from scroll to scroll.

### üßÆ Count Like a Conjurer{#count-things-reliably}

```sh
ls | count
```

Use `count` instead of `wc` to see what‚Äôs really there. Especially after commands like `ls` that like to decorate their output. `count` sees through the illusion ü™û and is specifically designed to handle browser shell quirks like inconsistent whitespace or multi-column output. If you're counting files ‚Äî this is the way. Period.

üìú With these tricks in hand, your shell scripting should feel a little more like spell weaving - and a lot less like debugging a cursed script. Happy conjuring! ‚ú®

## ü™® Known Spellbound Limitations

Even the most powerful tomes have their bounds. While the Tortal Shell is a spell-slinger‚Äôs delight, there are a few enchantments it just can‚Äôt conjure‚Äîyet.

### üí§ No True Concurrency

Scripts follow the path of a well-behaved wizard apprentice: one task at a time.

* No backgrounding (`&`)
* No `async` sorcery
* No parallel spell threads

üï∞ All magic happens in order, like a good queue at the potions shop. Pace your scrolls accordingly.

### üß± No Native Binaries (Muggles Only)

This is a browser, not a dungeon terminal. You cannot summon native binaries or system familiars.

```sh
# ‚ùå These shall not pass
make
python3 summon.py
```

All spells (commands) must be part of the shell‚Äôs sacred scrolls ‚Äî handcrafted in TypeScript, with care and possibly coffee.

### üì¶ Files are Virtual, Not Arcane Artifacts

You have a whole file system‚Äîhidden in browser space. But it's sandboxed tighter than a dragon egg vault.

* You can‚Äôt touch your actual hard drive üß±
* Uploaded files are temporarily borrowed via browser sorcery
* Everything lives in a magical storage dimension (a.k.a. localStorage or IndexedDB)

### üåê Network Access: Controlled Portals Only

You get `ping`, `curl`, and `nslookup` ‚Äî the officially sanctioned teleportation gates.

* ‚ùå No raw `fetch()`
* ‚ùå No `XMLHttpRequest`
* ‚ùå No socket spells or AJAX alchemy

üì° The browser‚Äôs magical firewall says: "*That‚Äôs enough internet for you.*"

### üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Bash-Like, Not Bash-Certified

The shell speaks fluent Bash-ish, but isn‚Äôt a full-blown Bash mage.

Unsupported incantations:
* ‚ùå No `[[ ... ]]` double-bracket tests
* ‚ùå No heredocs (`<<EOF`)
* ‚ùå No `select`, `until`

But fear not, for these spells are supported:
* ‚úÖ `if`, `else`, `elif`, `fi`
* ‚úÖ `for`, `while`, `case`, `done`
* ‚úÖ Function charms: `greet(name) { ... }`
* ‚úÖ `break`, `continue`, `return`, `exit`
* ‚úÖ All the arithmetic you need: `+ - * / % ++ -- += -=`
* ‚úÖ Command substitution: `whoami` or `$(date)`
* ‚úÖ Pipes (`|`), logic chains (`&&`,`||`)
* ‚úÖ Positional potions: `$1`, `$2`, etc.

In short: You get about 80% of a full Bash wizard‚Äôs staff, without the risk of summoning system demons.

üßû‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Use wisely, and enchant often.
