# Building a Project with Tortal Tech File Shell üìÇüîß

Tortal Tech File Shell is a library designed to streamline your file management tasks. It allows developers to read, modify, and manipulate file structures within their applications. This tutorial will guide you through setting up a project using Tortal Tech File Shell.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed:

- Node.js v14.x or later
- npm v6.x or later
- A code editor, such as Visual Studio Code

## Installation

First, install the Tortal Tech File Shell package. Open your terminal and run:

```
npm install tortal-tech-file-shell
```

This will download and install the library, making it available for use in your project.

## Project Setup

Create a new directory for your project and initialize it:

```
mkdir my-tortal-project
cd my-tortal-project
npm init -y
```

This creates a new folder named `my-tortal-project` and initializes it with a default `package.json` file.

## Using Tortal Tech File Shell

Let's explore basic usage of Tortal Tech File Shell.

### Importing the Library

In your project directory, create a new file named `app.js`. Open this file in your editor and add the Tortal Tech File Shell at the top:

```javascript
const FileShell = require('tortal-tech-file-shell');
```

### Reading a File

Use the library to read contents from a file. Modify `app.js` as follows to read a file named `example.txt`:

```javascript
const content = FileShell.readFileSync('example.txt');
console.log(content);
```

### Modifying a File

To write to a file and overwrite existing content, use the `writeFileSync` method:

```javascript
FileShell.writeFileSync('example.txt', 'Hello, Tortal!');
console.log('File updated. ‚úÖ');
```

### Appending to a File

To append data without overwriting existing content, use the `appendFileSync` method:

```javascript
FileShell.appendFileSync('example.txt', '\nAppending a new line.');
console.log('Content appended. ‚úèÔ∏è');
```

### Error Handling

Proper error handling is important. Wrap file operations within a try-catch block:

```javascript
try {
    const content = FileShell.readFileSync('example.txt');
    console.log(content);
} catch (error) {
    console.error('An error occurred while reading the file:', error.message);
}
```
